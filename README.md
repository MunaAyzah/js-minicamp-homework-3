Answers:

Object, Properties and Methods:
           
          Object are just like variable, Object consists of properties and method. Consider for example cat as an object it has properties like color: black and two eyes, Similarly consider method as it running , eating etc.

For in Loop: 
     
         For in loop is an iteration of taking particular variable with that of particular property of the given variable and executes them.

Dot notation vs bracket:

         Dot notion is if you know the name of the key e.g user.name
And use bracket notation if you don't because you are using a variable
E.g user[someKey.Both do the same function,though its better to use dot notation over brackets.
